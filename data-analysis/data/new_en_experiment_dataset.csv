"Organization, great people, education and way of treating the employee, many job openings and especially attention by the incredible phone",0
"They take too long to recognize a good employee and when they acknowledge he gets stuck in his position for being good there, and they promote what has more time of home for time not for quality",0
We have great freedom of home office and flexibity of schedule (as long as the demands are delivered promptly!). The environment is good to work with!,0
Difficulty of promotions and salary increases. The process is heavily plastered and virtually there is only promotion when it is for resource retention.,0
"The company has good benefits, I am allocated in customer, and I do not have much to talk about the company&#39;s internal politics and culture, the company has payment on time, good benefits, VT, VR, VA, VC, has an agreement with some institutions education, entertainment, health, among others.

"At the Recife unit specifically the weather is quite relaxed, the people are excellent and engaged. The work is not so drawn and the quality of life is one of the strengths of the company.",0
"At least in Recife unit works with public clients and this makes working difficult. There is not much motivation to work on the projects because they are not challenging enough. Another serious problem of this unit is the disconnection with the general identity of the company. The headquarters has no characterization of brands, branding or anything that identifies the company. Sometimes we see that the other units scattered around Brazil have marketing actions, customized venues, social projects, etc. However, in Recife if a person enters the headquarters of the company will not know what it is or what the company is in fact. This is ridiculous.",0

"HR does not know you exist, you can open called and send mail that they just can not help, this happened to many co-workers.

"Great company! relaxed atmosphere. differentiated location, employees with the young profile. company is always in contact with the collaborator through emails informing about the events and creating tools for the motivation and growth of the collaborator. Flexible working hours and a large part of the employees contribute to the climate that is currently satisfactory. The initial integration between the company and the employee gives the same a sense of position of the company where it works and that is makes a huge difference.",1
"Coordination is not very participatory and well reactive. managers often have more involvement than the coordinator. having knowledge of the size of the company, I believe that profit sharing could be better. the meal voucher does not meet the value of the region where the head office is located. and the Medical Agreement is co-participative. the distribution of the departments is favorable only to the managers (for us collaborators is terrible, as we are going up and down stairs and taking elevator). the company also does not promote and encourage employee integration.",1

Market compatible wage. The company takes care of the employee with attention to details such as commemorative days and birthdays. Access to various courses that add knowledge to the employee.,1

"HR is a mess, late payment of reimbursement, payment of benefits wrong, to want to have a career plan has to pull someone&#39;s bag, small salary for a lot of work, if you do not take care you end up exercising more functions than presents your contract and they do not increase your salary and neither does the position change and if you complain is a reason for resignation, if you claim your benefits when they do shit and you complain the next day you already sign your resignation, happened to several people who worked with me.",0
