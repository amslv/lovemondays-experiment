Everything is very good at Algar! It has points to improve but it is very good to work!,1
"The salary could be a little better, the leaders have little experience and usually do not give the account!",1
A great company with great cliebtes and good common technical team. It is a great environment to learn a lot about the ITO and eata standards with a strong expansion in the cable area.,1
The company loses several promising talents for lack of proper employee recognition and a lack of technical expertise on the part of management. &quot;,1
Friendly work environment and nationwide company. Possibility of adding knowledge of several sectors of retail and areas.,1
Failure to recognize the work of some employees is discouraging. Important company sectors like HR and Personal Department are disorganized and leave a lot to be desired &quot;,1

None. There is no way to think of any good points. The most messy company I&#39;ve ever worked on. Unfortunately I only have negative points from this company.,1
Company does not comply with what was agreed in the interview. From the first day until the last I had problems with benefits and the like. Any problem that the official has will always be called that takes 3 days to be answered and until the solution can take months. &quot;,1

"At least in Recife unit works with public clients and this makes working difficult. There is not much motivation to work on the projects because they are not challenging enough. Another serious problem of this unit is the disconnection with the general identity of the company. The headquarters has no characterization of brands, branding or anything that identifies the company. Sometimes we see that the other units scattered around Brazil have marketing actions, customized venues, social projects, etc. However, in Recife if a person enters the headquarters of the company will not know what it is or what the company is in fact.
